## Background

Are you interested in finding out more about me? Well, you came to the right place. I wanted to make something to tell a little about me and show some of my visual style (and have some fun with Vue as well!) Notably I kept a singular 'page model' so I can update content from one location.

## Technologies Used
- Vue.js
    - Single Page Components
    - Pug
    - VueScrollTo
- Parcel Bundler
